Following the principles transmitted by my teammates at [Talkdesk](http://www.talkdesk.com/), instilled on them through the blogs and books by software craftsmen (and women) like Michael Feathers, Sandi Metz and Uncle Bob just to name a few, I try to always write tests that cover the functionality I am implementing.

I cannot yet say I am truly following a *test-driven development* approach, since I still find myself falling into the implementation (almost unconsciously), eventually getting back to the tests. However, I push myself to stick with test-first and follow the Red, Green, Refactor cycle.

In this iterative process, one will often times run into some stone walls. I am talking about those tests that cannot seem to go from red to green no matter how immaculate your implementation is. You have bugs in your code, and you cannot seem to understand why or how they were introduced. What you know is that once you inspect your code, all will be clearer. So you do what you normally would do:

{% highlight ruby %}
puts v1.inspect
{% endhighlight %}

This is ok for testing purposes, right? You can inspect the value of the suspicious variable. Maybe you will get a grasp of what's happening and fix it right away. Great!

What happens when the situation involves more pieces of your system and you have suspicions on several different variables or areas of your code (or even worst, no suspicions at all)? You might end up with *not-so-great* code like the following, spread across different classes and modules:

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "v1: #{v1.inspect} v2: #{v2.inspect} v3: #{v3.inspect}"
{% endhighlight %}

Again, this code does not have to be *great*. It can even be bad as hell, right? Afterall, it is not meant for production. And while that is true, you will spend a lot of time writing that sort of stuff. You will also often times find you were inspecting the wrong variables, which will lead you to re-write the debugging instructions and run the tests back again. That is cumbersome and thus not very productive.

The other day while I was reviewing a pull request from [@KnuX](https://twitter.com/KnuX), he told me he had a masterplan to secretly sneak the [`pry`](https://github.com/pry/pry) gem in to every Ruby project in Talkdesk. I had used `pry` before, and it seemed cool, but it did not stick with me. I was *putsing* my way through my Ruby programming... After talking a bit about it with him, I decided to give it a second try.

Pry is an alternative to `irb`. It enables what [the author](https://twitter.com/banisterfiend) calls *REPL driven programming*. Although his vision seems to be achievable considering the usefulness of this tool, I must confess I only use it for debugging purposes (at least yet). But is goes a long way in its debugging strand.

So, on to the real stuff. Instead of having to write a long `puts` statement, I just inline this in my code:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'pry'; binding.pry
{% endhighlight %}

This will be the initial breakpoint in my code, in which I will be able to inspect variables much like you would do when you use `gdb` to debug C.

If I want to inspect variable `v1`, I just ask for its value.

![alt text](/img/debugging-ruby/2.png "Inspect v1")

We can call instance methods on the variables and check the result, as expected.

![alt text](/img/debugging-ruby/3.png "Inspect v2")

This is awesome! No more long `puts` and better, more powerful inspection!

One thing about `gdb` is that it provides `step`, `next`, `break`, etc. out of the box. This is what I would like to have in `pry`. Turns out this is not possible to have with "vanilla `pry`", but there is a whole community releasing plugins to `pry`, such as the awesome [`pry-byebug`](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/pry-byebug) which introduces the following commands:

- `step` to move inside the current instruction
- `next` to move past the current instruction
- `finish` to step out of the current stack frame
- `continue` to continue the program execution
- `break` to add a breakpoint

This is Ã¼ber awesome! We can now inspect the flow of our programs in a much more controlled way. This helps a lot when debugging those reds you so eagerly want to turn green.

If you start using `pry` a lot (like I now do), it might be useful for you to add the following to your `~/.pryrc`:

{% highlight ruby %}
if defined?(PryByebug)
  Pry.commands.alias_command 'c', 'continue'
  Pry.commands.alias_command 's', 'step'
  Pry.commands.alias_command 'n', 'next'
  Pry.commands.alias_command 'f', 'finish'
  Pry.commands.alias_command 'b', 'break'
end
{% endhighlight %}

This will allow you to simply call `n` when you want to call `next`, and so on. I also recommend you reading through [the documentation of `pry-byebug`](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/pry-byebug#pry-byebug) to get a better grasp of its possibilities.

Say **no** to `puts`. Long live `pry`!
