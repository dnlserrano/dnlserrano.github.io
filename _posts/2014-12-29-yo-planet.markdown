This is the first post of my personal blog.
I think it is going to be a kind of collection of fun or weird things surrounding code and life in general. I'm still making it up as I go along.

If you ever want to hit me up, feel free to do so [@dnlserrano](https://www.twitter.com/dnlserrano).

See you in a bit.
