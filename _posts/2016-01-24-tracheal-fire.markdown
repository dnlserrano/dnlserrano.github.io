It's been a while. And to change that, I'm doing a blog post about something different than the usual.

The tagline in my person blog reads "code and life in general." So far, I've only been able to write about the first one. But since music is such an important part of my life, I thought this was the right time to do a blog post on the genre I gravitate towards the most: hip-hop.

Since last year, I've began to listen to some really interesting new artists that I've been introduced to in various ways, and I thought I'd just write a few words on each of them. That way, I can spread the word about their existence while I try to explain why I think they have the possibility to explode in much the same way other artists have been able to. So here it is, my top 3 of soon-to-be major hip-hop stars (ordered from least to most appreciated).

# CJ Flemings

[That Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHOyICMLCo8)'s too-catchy-not-to-explode chorus mixed with fair rapping abilities and trendy production details end up making for a good song that got me wishing for more. After a quick search, I found out about his then-recent EP ["Next One To Enjoy"](http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/cj-flemings-next-one-to-enjoy-new-mixtape.116005.html), which is pretty much rock solid if you're into an RnB-ish type hip-hop with trap-influenced beats. Again, this guy knows how to pull choruses. He's also featured in [J.O The Corrupted's Promise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae9M-DRDzPU). Give the kid a try. I think you won't regret it.

# Tory Lanez

With a career that goes as far back as 2009, I only really got to know Tory Lanez after his WeDidIt-produced EP ["Cruel Intentions"](http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tory-lanez-cruel-intentions-new-mixtape.115895.html). In the sickest song of that EP, "In For It", RL Grime produces a kick-filled, hi hat-sprinkled and time-warp-tinted beat only matched by Tory Lanez's delivery of a dark, honest and very real ambiance and overall mood. The rest of the songs speak for themselves and I believe this EP stands out as both a work of Tory Lanez as well as a WeDidIt very well-crafted production effort.

Tory has since then dropped two other mixtapes, ["Chixtape III"](http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tory-lanez-chixtape-3-new-mixtape.116189.html) and ["The New Toronto"](http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tory-lanez-the-new-toronto-new-mixtape.116190.html), this last one containing the banger "Makaveli", in which Tory shows he doesn't just sing but he is also able to spit fast, nasty, sing-along-type rhymes. And also "Other Side", to reminds us he "came from the bottom" and that "they did [him] no favors." His ego is enormous. "Illest nigga since big poppa."

Aside from the EPs and mixtapes, Tory has been putting out [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rO7_UAxBqk) [after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUq1rZ7mmns) [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K239Z8YzWI) unrelated with any of the aforementioned projects. They're heavy. Get on it.

# Bryson Tiller

The main event. God Tiller.

[Swing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmjVNhN0rpo&t=7m17s) put it best. The beats are amazing. His flow is top notch. Probably my favorite artist from 2015. He's fire.

It all started with ["Don't"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7cVLE4SaN0). Uploaded to SoundCloud, it reached over 35 million streams. The video has 45 million youtube hits. Okay, this guys isn't up-and-coming anymore, but I had to talk about him, because he was the best thing in hip-hop in 2015. There was not a single song by Tiller that I listened to that was not good. Of course there are some better than others, but there is not a single one that is bad.

> Fanboy much?

<center><img src="/img/tracheal-fire/when-u-listen-god-tiller.gif" /></center>

Yes.

When he dropped his full-length mixtape, ["TRAPSOUL"](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/t-r-a-p-s-o-u-l/id1031354875) me and all of SoundCloud were eagerly waiting for it. And it did not disappoint one bit. "Exchange", "502 Come Up" and "Sorry Not Sorry" are between the most memorable songs on it. But my personal favorite is "Rambo". That start. "Listen." It sets you up for what's coming. And what coming is good. As DJ Khaled would put it, "It is good. It is very good."

"They begging for mercy like the Lambo." All of this, really. I don't mean to sound like a fanboy, but I realize by now that I really can't hide it. If you don't believe that this guy is good, just listen to the album. And then try not to listen to it again. I doubt you'll be able to.

"I'm as humble as they come, but you're fucking with the wrong one." Damn!

Thankfully, he suffers from the same condition as Tory Lanez, and he just can't stop dropping new material. His SoundCloud is full of [exclusive](https://soundcloud.com/brysontiller/bryson-tiller-self-righteous-prod-by-ayo) [hits](https://soundcloud.com/brysontiller/break-bread-feat-king-vory) and [freestyles](https://soundcloud.com/brysontiller/dont-worry-molly-freestyle).

Grab it while it's hot. But then again, I'm hoping it will stay hot for a long time.
